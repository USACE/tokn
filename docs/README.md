Download the latest `tokn-x.x.x.Setup.exe` from https://github.com/USACE/tokn/releases/latest

Depending on the browser used, you may have to explicitly allow the file to be downloaded

The file should be downloaded to `Downloads`, but in the event Windows won't allow the file to be saved, save it to `C:\Temp`

Since the file was downloaded from the web, it can't be executed without the following checkbox checked:

![unblock exe](img/unblock-exe.png 'unblock file')

After checking `Unblock` and clicking `OK`, you are ready to double click to launch the Tokn setup.

When setup is complete, you will see the main Tokn window.

Click Login (may be prompted for CAC PIN). The login button should turn green with your username displayed.

You can then close the window.  Tokn will remain running in the system tray.

If you need to start the app after quiting or after a reboot, use the shortcut on the desktop.
